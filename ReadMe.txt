This is a project to make a snake game in C++.

The objective of this game is to move the snake around the grid using the WASD keys while trying to maneuver your snake into (and so "eat") the 
pieces of fruit appearing on-screen. When a piece of fruit is eaten the snake's tail increases in size (starting at 0). The game is ended when the user quits 
(by pressing Q), runs into a wall or runs into the tail.

The speed of the game should be adjusted based on the power of the processor running it. Change the value passed to the sleep function to 
change the speed of the game. If you want to change the size of the grid change the height and width integers.
